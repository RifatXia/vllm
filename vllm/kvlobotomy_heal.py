"""Hash table healing after KV cache deletion.

After kvlobotomy_full_delete() compacts the KV cache data on the GPU,
the prefix cache hash table on the scheduler side has stale entries.
This module selectively heals the hash table so that both A and C
get cache hits on subsequent queries.

Healing strategy:
  1. Compute block hashes for the OLD (ABC) and NEW (AC) token sequences
  2. Find the first block where hashes diverge (this is where B starts,
     or the block straddling the A/B boundary)
  3. From that block onward: remove old hash entries, collect physical blocks
  4. Re-register those physical blocks with the new (AC) hashes
  5. Free any tail blocks that are beyond the new sequence length

Usage from experiment script:
    from vllm.kvlobotomy_heal import heal_prefix_cache_after_delete
    result = heal_prefix_cache_after_delete(llm, abc_token_ids, delete_start, delete_end)

    Without this, blocks grabbed via ``get_new_blocks`` in ``extend_block_table``
    stay allocated, and ``reset_prefix_cache()`` silently fails (its
    num_used_blocks==1 invariant is violated). The next ``llm.chat()`` then
    hits the stale hash map registered by ``heal_prefix_cache_after_replace``
    and reuses the surgery-written blocks as a bogus prefix-cache hit.

    Call this AFTER the evaluation ``llm.chat()`` completes, BEFORE the next
    ``reset_prefix_cache()``.

    **IMPORTANT — pass only the NEWLY ALLOCATED blocks, not the full table.**
    The blocks that were already owned by a live sequence when you captured
    ``block_table`` (via ``get_physical_block_table``) are managed by vLLM's
    sequence lifecycle — those you must NOT touch. Double-freeing them leads
    to ``AssertionError: block.ref_cnt == 0`` on subsequent allocations.

        # ... surgery + heal + chat ...
        release_surgery_blocks(llm, extended_bt)

    Steps:
      1. Evict the cached hashes for every block in ``block_table`` — removes
         those block_hash entries from the hash table.
      2. Decrement ref_cnt via ``free_blocks`` — returns blocks with ref_cnt=0
         to the free_block_queue.

    After this, ``reset_prefix_cache()`` sees num_used_blocks == 1 (null block
